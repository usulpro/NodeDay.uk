      "description": "<p>React keeps on evolving and making hard things easier for the average developer.
One case, where React was not particularly hard but very repetitive, is working with AJAX request. There is always the trinity of loading, success and possible error states that had to be handled each time. But no more as the <code>&#x3C;Suspense /></code> component makes life much easier.
Another case is performance of larger and complex applications. Usually React is fast enough but with a large application rendering components can conflict with user interactions. Concurrent rendering will, mostly automatically, take care of this.</p>
<p>Join Maurice with your laptop in this interactive workshop. You will learn all about using <Suspense />, showing loading indicators and handling errors. You will see how easy it is to get started with concurrent rendering. You will make suspense even more capable by combining it with concurrent rendering, the <code>useTransition()</code> hook and the <SuspenseList /> component.</p>
