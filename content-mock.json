The conference unites library authors and core teams with engineers having a summer Amsterdam as a background. We recognize JavaScript development as an art of engineering, and that's why the conference offers both a JS-driven art exhibition and audiovisual performances powered with JavaScript during the afterparty. The next day after the event, we'll explore the well-known Amsterdam museums together, and later on, we'll gather for a picnic/hangout in the Vondelpark. </p>\n",

But no more as the <code>&#x3C;Suspense /></code> component makes life much easier.\nAnother case is performance of larger and complex applications. Usually React is fast enough but with a large application rendering components can conflict with user interactions. Concurrent rendering will, mostly automatically, take care of this.</p>\n<p>Join Maurice with your laptop in this interactive workshop. You will learn all about using <Suspense />, showing loading indicators and handling errors. You will see how easy it is to get started with concurrent rendering.
